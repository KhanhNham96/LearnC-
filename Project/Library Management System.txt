Menus for different user roles, book management, and member actions.

Use C++ file streams (fstream) to save and load the library data to and from a file.
Implement Search Capabilities:

Use standard algorithms (std::find, std::find_if) along with lambda functions or custom search predicates.
Error Handling:

Ensure that users cannot borrow books that are already borrowed.
Check for valid input throughout the system.
Provide feedback messages for successful or failed operations.
Bonus Features:

Implement overdue notifications.
Add user registration and login capabilities.
Implement a rating system where members can rate books.
Tools and Libraries:

Basic C++ (No external libraries are needed for the core functionality).
C++ Standard Library (for containers like std::vector, std::map, file I/O, algorithms, etc.).
